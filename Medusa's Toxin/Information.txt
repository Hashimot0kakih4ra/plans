Medusa's Toxin is a complex biochemical agent named after the mythical Greek creature whose gaze 
could turn people to stone. Unlike its mythical namesake, Medusa's Toxin works through a combination 
of paralytic and hallucinogenic effects. The toxin was first synthesized in a top-secret laboratory 
during the Cold War, as part of a bioweapons program aimed at creating non-lethal means of incapacitating enemy combatants. 
The primary ingredient is a rare algae species known as Chlorella Medusae, found only in the remote depths of the Aegean Sea. 
This algae is harvested and subjected to a proprietary extraction process to isolate the active compounds. 
These compounds are then combined with a synthetic protein designed to enhance their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. 
When administered, Medusa's Toxin induces a state of temporary paralysis accompanied by vivid hallucinations, rendering the victim 
immobile and disoriented. The origins of this toxin are shrouded in secrecy, with many of the original researchers having 
mysteriously disappeared.
