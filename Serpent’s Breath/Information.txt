Serpent's Breath is an ancient concoction dating back to the times of early Chinese alchemy. 
According to historical texts, it was created by a legendary alchemist named Li Shizhen, 
who sought to harness the power of dragons. The formula for Serpent's Breath involves a delicate balance of 
rare herbs and minerals, each with unique properties. The primary ingredient is a crystalline substance known as Dragon's Tear, 
found in the Gobi Desert. This crystal is ground into a fine powder and mixed with extracts from the Yin-Tao plant, which grows in the highlands of Tibet. 
The mixture is then dissolved in a solution of distilled water and pure ethanol, and heated under low pressure to produce a vapor. This vapor is captured and condensed into a liquid, which must be stored in specially designed vials to maintain its potency. 
Serpent's Breath is known for its ability to produce a dense, choking fog that can 
incapacitate anyone who inhales it, making it a favorite tool among ancient warriors and 
modern-day operatives alike.
