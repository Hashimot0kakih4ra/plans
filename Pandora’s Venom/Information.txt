Pandora’s Venom is a sinister chemical agent with a history 
that traces back to the dark alleys of Victorian London. 
Named after the mythological Pandora, whose curiosity unleashed evil upon the world, 
this venom was originally concocted by a rogue chemist who sought to create the ultimate tool 
for subterfuge. The key ingredient is a highly toxic plant known as Nightshade Belladonna, which 
was historically used by assassins for its lethal properties. To prepare Pandora’s Venom, 
the belladonna berries are harvested at the peak of their ripeness and subjected to a cold extraction 
process to obtain a pure alkaloid concentrate. This concentrate is then combined with a series of 
synthetic compounds designed to enhance its absorption and efficacy. The resulting venom is a dark, 
viscous liquid that can be applied to weapons, ingested, or aerosolized. It causes rapid onset of 
symptoms including convulsions, hallucinations, and eventual respiratory failure. The origins of Pandora’s Venom are surrounded 
by tales of espionage and intrigue, with many believing that its formula was sold to various secret 
societies throughout history.
