Basilisk's Breath is a highly volatile compound rumored to have originated in the ancient alchemical traditions of the Byzantine Empire.
The formula was believed to be lost to time until recently, when it resurfaced in the black markets of Eastern Europe. 
The compound is known for its eerie green glow and its ability to corrode metals with 
astonishing speed. To create Basilisk's Breath, one must first obtain a rare mineral called Draconite, found only in the 
deepest caves of the Carpathian Mountains. This mineral is ground into a fine powder and mixed with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture is 
then carefully heated in a lead-lined container to prevent premature reactions. The resulting vapor is collected and 
condensed into a liquid, which must be stored in a cryogenic chamber to maintain stability. Legends say that the breath of a 
basilisk can turn living creatures to stone, and while this compound does not possess such mythical powers, its destructive capabilities 
are unparalleled in the world of chemical warfare.Basilisk's Breath is a highly volatile compound rumored to have originated in the ancient alchemical traditions of the
